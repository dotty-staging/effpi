# Effpi: verified message-passing programs in Dotty

Effpi is an experimental toolkit for _strongly-typed_ concurrent and
distributed programming in [Dotty](https://dotty.epfl.ch/) (a.k.a. the
future Scala 3 programming language), with verification capabilities
based on _type-level model checking_.

The home page of Effpi is: <https://alcestes.github.io/effpi>

**Note**: to compile Effpi, JDK 11 is recommended.
